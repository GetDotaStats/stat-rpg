GetDotaStats Stat-Collection
=====

###About###
 - The code and concept is very much a work in progress. Please refer to http://getdotastats.com/#d2mods__guide for a detailed guide, and for up to date contact details (at the bottom).
 - This repo should contain all of the code required to get stats working. Make sure to go through each file and adapt as required. It has been stripped back to just the parts you need to implement. It will not work "out of the box", without some adaptation.
 
###Credits###
 - Big thanks to SinZ163, Tet, and Ash47 for their hard-work in testing and developing the Lua and Flash code that makes this all possible. I take no credit for the Lua and Flash found in this repo, as I have just collated and reformatted it.

###Implementations###
 - Ash47 (live) [Legends of Dota] - https://github.com/ash47/LegendsOfDota
